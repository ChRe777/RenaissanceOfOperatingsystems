# Renaissance of operating systems

The renaissance of operating systems.

People should help smaller operatings to grow up
and be connectable with others os by open standard.

In a way that this OS can work together but virus
and malware can not do anything on other os.

So we need to have much more apis much more programming
languages. So that we are not able to execute a virus
on a foreign operatings system.

## Vision

I believe we need all old operationg system back.

Like bio diversity we need a lot of old operatings system.

A virus or a malware should that was written for one
operatings should not be able to attack another operatings
system.

Like with a natural virus that works on a biological being
should not work on another type of being.

Because you can bring all UNix system with a stndard
together they are vunerable. If they share the same
interfaces like POSIX then this is a problem.

## Monoculture

What we have currently is a monoculture a 3 big operation
systems (Mac,Win,Linux, other Unix(e))

## Other Operating Systems

Each operating system should have it own
programming language or api so a virus for instance
for operatings systems A should not be able to
attack this operation system.

Not by special security stuff. But only by having
many heterogen enviroments connected together.

### Plan 9

Plan 9 is great operating system

### Haiku Os (BeOS)

Haiku OS is a great small operating systems.

### Oberon OS

Is a very good old os. where everything is different so
there is hard to have a virus to run there. 

### Multics

### UNIX(e)

All unixe shared the same standard like POSIX. So
it is possbile to compile and run the code on the
other operatingsystem. This looks nice, but it is
also problematic. Because if there is a open
door in a library you also have it on the other
operatings system.

I believe a operatings should could communicate through
standard like html, tcp or what ever. BUt the code
that come over the line feels totally in a foreign
enviroment, where he has no place to life. A virus should
like be on the mars and not survive on an operating he
was not made for.

### Exotic Operating System

The more an operation system is very exotic the better
it is more diversity and the better it against monoulture.
Like in the nature with have so much different type of
plants and animals. And this diversity has a great power
in survive everything.
